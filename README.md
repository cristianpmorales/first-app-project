# Canvasser Application
The goal of this project is to create an online canvasser list. Where an Admin has an ability of creating a list and the person door knocking is updating a database. Currently this process is being done manually, which waste a vast amount of paper and takes time from the admin since they have to update a list manually.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Mongo

HTML, CSS and Javascript were used to build the front end user expirence. The canvasser page closely resembles what a paper sheet looks like with the option to chose between scripts, and having the name of the voter ready available instead of searching for it on a sheet.

## Optimizations

App is still not ready for production but all updates/changes will be added here
